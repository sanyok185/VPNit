							<summary class="questions__title spollers__title _icon-arrow">How does a VPNit work?</summary>
							<div class="questions__body spollers__body">
								<p>
									A VPN is short for "Virtual Private Network". It is a secure encrypted connection between your computer and one of our servers. As a user, you would use your internet normally and your internet connection will be secure and anonymous. While connected, your real IP address will change and you will appear to be at a different location (US). When connected you will experience internet freedom. If you are in a country with internet restrictions, you would be able to bypass them.</p>

						<details class="questions__item spollers__item">
							<summary class="questions__title spollers__title _icon-arrow">Is it legal to use a VPNit?</summary>
							<div class="questions__body spollers__body">
								<p>Yes, it is legal to use a VPNit. Many companies use the technology to allow remote employees access to their networks remotely. We use the same technology and provide you internet access over the VPN connection.</p>

							<summary class="questions__title spollers__title _icon-arrow">I've successfully purchased VPN but never received a message to my email, what should I do?</summary>
							<div class="questions__body spollers__body">
								<p>We're always kindly asking our customers to check the SPAM/JUNK folders after the purchase. In most cases the message will be found there. Also note that the average delivery time is 5-30 minutes depending on your email service provider.</p>
								<br>
								<p>If you filled in wrong/out of service email address, then please contact <a href="mailto:">support.</a></p>

							<div class="questions__body spollers__body">
								<p>Yes. The VPNit monthly plans are one time charge only. No recurring payments. It means that you will pay only once when you sign up for some plan and when it will expire you will not be charged again. You will need to make a new payment to use VPNit service again.</p>

							<summary class="questions__title spollers__title _icon-arrow">What are some of the benefits? What can I use your VPN service for?</summary>
							<div class="questions__body spollers__body">
								<p>You would be secure and anonymous online and depending on your location you will see added benefits. For example, if you are in Belize, Oman and UAE you can use Skype normally to make international calls, this is blocked if you are not using our service. If you are in China, KSA, Qatar, Thailand etc you can access blocked sites including adult websites. Geoblocking can be overcome too and you can watch Netflix, Hulu etc from abroad. Those are just a few of the benefits.</p>

						<details class="questions__item spollers__item">
							<summary class="questions__title spollers__title _icon-arrow">Do you block torrent sites? Do you allow torrent downloads & p2p?</summary>
							<div class="questions__body spollers__body">
								<p>YES! We block torrent sites and p2p programs. To prevent legal complications that could arise, as a user you will not be able to access torrent sites and use the service to download files with a P2P software such as emule, Azureus, uTorrent etc. Torrent sites such as piratebay are also blocked. We actively block them on our network, so if you are wanting a VPN to hide your IP in order to engage in copyright infringement this is not the solution. We prefer a clean network and happy users.</p>

							<summary class="questions__title spollers__title _icon-arrow">Is a VPN Connection the same as a Proxy websites?</summary>
							<div class="questions__body spollers__body">
								<p>Both the technologies will change your IP address. A VPN would encrypt all your internet traffic and all your internet applications will route traffic via the secure connection. A proxy is mainly browser based and many sites will not load via a proxy browser. VPNit service is also much faster than a proxy.</p>

							<summary class="questions__title spollers__title _icon-arrow">Is my computer operating system supported? How do I configure it to connect?</summary>

								<p>Our service works with computers using Windows XP, Windows VISTA, Windows 7, Windows 8, Macintosh OS and Linux. However, we do not provide support for configuring a linux operating system. No software download is required in order to use our services as we utilize the VPN feature already in your computer operating system.</p>
								<p>Once you subscribe, we will send you all the VPN account information required to set up a connection. You will follow some simply instruction to set up the VPN connection and enter the login details that we will email you once payment clears.</p>

							<summary class="questions__title spollers__title _icon-arrow">I cannot connect to the server. The VPNit connection fails what should I try first?</summary>
							<div class="questions__body spollers__body">
								<p>If you are unable to connect to the VPN server here are some quick things to consider.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>(1) The first thing to do with any error is reboot the computer, router/modem. When internet resumes, test the VPN connection</li>
									<li>(2) Type account details, do not copy and paste and note the CAPS in the password if any. Sometimes when you copy & paste your password a blank space is added at the end.</li>
									<li>(3) Try both L2TP IPsec, PPTP and if applicable SSTP. With L2TP IPsec you will need to use a preshared key / Shared secret stated in the welcome email.</li>
									<li>(4) If you are using a wireless connection, try the connection while connected via a cable directly to the modem.</li>
									<li>(5) Please check your firewall settings. Disable/configure firewall such as Norton, Zone alarm, OneCare by adding the server IP to the "trusted" list. If you are able to connect when the firewall is disabled, set an exception for all traffic to the VPN server IP address. If not sure how to do that, contact us and let us know what program you are using.</li>

							<summary class="questions__title spollers__title _icon-arrow">Will using VPN slow down my internet?</summary>
							<div class="questions__body spollers__body">
								<p>We'll be honest and frank with you here unlike those who claim a big "NO, it won't". Actually no one can tell you the answer without testing on your system. It depends on a lot of factors e.g your proximity to the server location, your ISP's support of protocols etc.</p>

							<div class="questions__body spollers__body">
								<p>Once you are connected to our VPN server, all programs use a virtual network interface, which protects all programs that access internet on your computer. It's far more safer and effective than a regular proxy.</p>
